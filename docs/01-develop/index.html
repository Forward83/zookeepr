Developing ZooKeepr
===================

This section of the documentation is designed to:

* Tools - making sure you have all the development tools that you need to get started
* Environments - making sure you can create and configure your environments to begin development
* Revision control - making sure you know how to branch, commit and push changes to appropriate branches and repositories

### Tools

In order to develop on ZooKeepr, you will need the following tools and preliminary knowledge.

* [Git](http://www.github.com) - Ideally, you will have some exposure to *source control* and *revision control* using git, and using local and remote repositories in GitHub. Here are some links to get you started if you're not already comfortable in git;
  - [Pro Git book online](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  - [Listing of Git clients](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
  - [Scott Chacon of GitHub provides a video introduction to Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY)

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Ideally, if you are developing, you will have some exposure to the Python programming language.
  - [Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) ZooKeepr is built in Pylons. An understanding of this framework will be useful.

* [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) - The ZooKeepr backend is build on the Postgres relational database.

* [Alemic](https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Alembic is used for database migration activities.

* HTML and CSS - the front end of ZooKeepr is built in HTML and CSS. It is useful to have at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
